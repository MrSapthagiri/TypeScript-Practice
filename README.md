# TypeScript Practice Project

This project contains TypeScript practice questions and example solutions, organized by topic in different folders.

## How to Run the Code

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) installed globally:
  ```
  npm install -g typescript
  ```

---

## Running Example Files

### 1. Navigate to the Project Directory
Open your terminal and go to the project root:
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\yourpathlocation\TypeScript Practice"
```
tsc "Into .ts"; node "Into .js"

---

### 2. Compile and Run a TypeScript File
To run any `.ts` file, use the following steps:

#### Example: Run a file from `src/Into Practice Sheets`
```powershell
cd src

tscc "Into Practice Sheets/relativeCoding.ts"
node "Into Practice Sheets/relativeCoding.js"
```

Replace `relativeCoding.ts` with any file you want to run.

---

### 3. Run All Example Files Together
A main file is provided to run all examples at once:

```powershell
tscc "Into Practice Sheet.ts"
node "Into Practice Sheet.js"
```

---

## Folder Structure
- `src/Into Practice Sheets/` — Contains example TypeScript files for each question.
- `Into .ts` — Practice sheet with 25 TypeScript questions and answers.
- `src/Into Practice Sheet.ts` — Imports and runs all example files in one go.

---

## Notes
- Do **not** put terminal commands (like `tsc ...` or `node ...`) inside `.ts` files. Only TypeScript/JavaScript code should be in `.ts` files.
- If you add new `.ts` files, compile and run them using the steps above.

---

Happy coding!
